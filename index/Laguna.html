    <h1>HAUNNTED HISTORICAL PLACE IN LAGUNA</h1>

   
    <p>Remarked by many as “a haunted house”, the Villa Valenzuela Or NG KASTILYO NG SANTA CRUZ, LAGUNA | KASAYSAYAN  is a hundred-year old treasure that has been sitting quietly along the bank of Santa Cruz River. It is located at one end of the Santa Cruz Bridge, locally referred to as “Malaking Tulay,” which means “Big Bridge.” Politically, it is under the jurisdiction of Barrio Sto. Angel Sur. The “Malaking Tulay” is an important infrastructure as it connects the capital of Santa Cruz, Laguna to the far-flung barrios of the town.
                                            MORE THAN A HAUNTED HOUSE…
        According to the current owner of the house (who refused to be named), the house was built in 1919. Peter Jaynul Uckung, the Division Head of Laguna Tourism, Culture and the Arts Office (LTCATO) confirmed that this was also around the time the municipal building of Santa Cruz had been built.
      
        The current owner’s grandfather named Don Jacinto Valenzuela, also known as “Don Intong” was the original owner.
         The Valenzuelas were one of the most prominent families during that time. In fact, Don Jacinto was the alcalde of the town from 1926 to 1929</p>

    Pila Municipal Center built in 1931 and recently restored.

Many of the ancestral houses may be found surrounding the town plaza. Expecting to find Spanish colonial era houses in the traditional bahay na bato style similar to those in Taal and Vigan, we were mildly surprised to discover that most of the homes are early 20th Century structures and represented a shift towards American chalet-style houses with a mixture of Spanish and native elements and Art Deco design fixtures.

SANTA ROSA DE LIMA PARISH CHURCH (Brgy. Kanluran)

The church of Santa Rosa Laguna was built sometime in 1796, and its first curo paracco or parish priest was Padre Francisco Favier. The church, which was built during the Hispanic era, is made of adobe, bricks and stone. And just like the typical church built during the colonial era, The Santa Rosa de Lima church sits right in front of a large plaza. One of the highlights of this church is ist hexagonal-shaped belfry with a globe on top of it. Other important details are its doors with its intricate carvings.

Construction of the Santa Rosa de Lima Parish Church begun in 1796. The citizenry helped in the procurement of materials. They supplied albumin (egg white) which when mixed with lime and mortar served as cement that cohered the adobe stones firmly. After 16 years, the church was completed. The Zavalla Manuscripts disclosed that the church was blessed on August 4, 1812 and the first holy mass with homily was celebrated on August 30, 1812.

STA. ROSA CITY — In recent decades, Cuartel de Santo Domingo, or Fort Santo Domingo, in this city in Laguna province came to be known as a detention facility for high-profile crime suspects in the country.
Janet Lim-Napoles, alleged pork barrel scam mastermind, was held inside the 8-hectare compound in 2013. Before her were former President Joseph Estrada, Sen. Gringo Honasan, and Moro National Liberation Front founder Nur Misuari.

“There’s now a double declaration. This is rare [for any historical] landmark,” Batino said.

The National Historical Commission of the Philippines (NHCP, or formerly the National Historical Institute) declared the old facility a national historical landmark on July 21, 2005.

Built by the Spaniards in 1877 on the sprawling Dominican hacienda, the two-story adobe building served as an outpost of the Guardia Civil to protect Sta. Rosa from bandits.
